# glsl-lsp
This repository contains a heavily **work-in-progress** project aiming to provide a language extension for the OpenGL Shading Language.

This is targetting GLSL `450` & `460` initially, but there are plans to support older versions in the future, including but not limited to `110`, `300 es`, `330` and `410`.

âš  **Current state of functionality**: Basic semantic highlighting and syntax diagnostics reporting. Full support for macro expansion and conditional compilation. Currently not packaged so you have to build from source.
