# glsl-lsp
This repository contains a heavily **work-in-progress** project aiming to provide a language extension for the OpenGL Shading Language.

This is targetting versions `450`/`460` initially, but there are plans to support older versions in the future, such as `330 es`.

âš  Current state of functionality: Working on a big refactor of the parser library; lsp is broken.
