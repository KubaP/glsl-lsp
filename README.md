# glsl-lsp
This repository contains a heavily **work-in-progress** project aiming to provide a language extension for the OpenGL Shading Language.

This project is targeting GLSL `450` & `460` initially, but there are plans to support older versions in the future, including but not limited to `110`, `300 es`, `330` and `410`.

**An extension for Visual Studio Code is available on the [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kuba-p.glsl-lsp).**

âš  Current state of functionality: Basic semantic highlighting and syntax diagnostics reporting. Advanced support for macro expansion and conditional compilation.
