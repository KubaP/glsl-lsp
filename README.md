# glsl-lsp
This repository contains a heavily **work-in-progress** project aiming to provide a language extension for the OpenGL Shading Language.

Currently targetting versions `450`/`460` initially, but there are plans to support older versions in the future, such as `330 es`.

âš  Current state of functionality: Most syntax errors are reported, but the parser doesn't properly support all valid notations.
