## Security & Privacy
This extension, and the `glsl-lsp` server, do not execute arbitrary source code; any evaluations are free of any side-effects. Furthermore, currently no I/O or network calls are made.

No telemetry is collected by this extension.

## Installation
Simply install this extension and you're good to go! The platform-specific server binary is packaged along with all the other files, so there's no need to download extra stuff through a separate package manager.

## Troubleshooting
This extension is in a preview state and it has not been fully tested. Crashes may occur. 

Start troubleshooting by looking at the server logs. Log messages are found in the `Output > GLSL Language Server` channel. If you see a backtrace, that means the server has crashed. Log messages from this extension's language client are found in the `Output > GLSL Client` channel.

To fully capture the messages between the editor and the server, set the `glsl.trace.server` setting to `"verbose"`. These messages will be logged to the `Output > GLSL Language Server Trace` channel.

If you encounter a crash or bug, please file an [issue in the repo](https://github.com/KubaP/glsl-lsp/issues). The issue guide outlines the steps necessary to produce a high quality bug report; this is really appreciated as it makes the bug quicker to track down and fix. You can get the current version information by running `GLSL: Show version` from the command palette.
